# custom-robot-design-ros2-gazebo-sim
 hands-on ROS 2 project to understand coordinate transforms (TFs), design a custom robot using URDF, and simulate it in Gazebo. This repository covers the complete pipeline from robot modeling to real-time simulation, enabling a strong foundation in ROS 2-based robotic system development.
